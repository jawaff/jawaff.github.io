My name is Jake Waffle and this is my hobby website for displaying my projects and thoughts.
My hope is to one day build up an archive of information and projects that anybody can
learn from. Those types of sources are crucial for upcoming and seasoned developers. I believe 
that developers have a responsibility to give back some of their knowledge to the world so that our
society can progress. This is exactly why I'm for open standards(e.g. hardware/software interfaces) 
and open source technology.

My development interests are pretty vast:
- Java, C++, Python and LaTeX Programming Languages
- Distributed Systems such as Microservices and Docker Swarms
- Context Oriented Programming (COP)
- Java Concurrency
- Functional Java
- UE4 C++
- Software Architecture and Design
- Open Standards
- Open Source Technology
