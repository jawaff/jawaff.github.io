As of today, it has been around 6 years since I abandoned a Python game framework that I was experimenting. Looking back at the project now, I'm amazed at how inconsistent and unstructured my code was.
There are a lot of conventions that I picked up on without fully understanding and there wasn't a clear direction for how to maintain and distribute the project. However, I will also say that the framework
also had some really neat features and a solid architecture in terms of its ideas.
