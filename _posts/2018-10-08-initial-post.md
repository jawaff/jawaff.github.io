# Hello

My name is Jake Waffle and I'm currently a Software Engineer at Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories. My strongest languages would have to be Java, C/C++ and Python.
I'm just so happy that I continued to pursue this career. I've been programming since I was around 14 years old and I haven't taken any significant brakes since then. 
It's been so much fun building applications and libraries over the years.

I'm fairly late to the game with my blog. Thus, a lot of my posts will hopefully cover some of the cool projects that I did a while back. It might be a good learning
experience by itself to just go back and see how I wrote programs years ago.
